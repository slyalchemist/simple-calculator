# Simple Calculator

## Description
This project was a final test of my foundational skills in HTML/CSS/JS. 

For this project, the objective was to create a functional, simple calculator, like one you would find on a smartphone (albeit even more simple than those).

Through this project, I improved my foundational skills such as problem-solving, function creating, naming conventions, project management, and DOM manipulation.
